# Weekly Update (Template) Generator
---

Title's pretty self-explanatory. It's a simple script that let's you generate a template for a summarized weekly report for whatever reason you might need it for.
I made this specifically so that I don't have to spend more time than necessary to insert the dates and ensure the format's alright every week.

## Template
This is pretty much what it throws out in a file called `sample.md`.

Note:
I've purposely set the file creation to append instead of write 'cause it's easy to overwrite your update otherwise.

```
ðŸ“† Weekly Update  ðŸ“†
